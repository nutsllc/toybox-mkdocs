## What is the MKDocs

>MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

>### Host anywhere
Builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages, Amazon S3, or anywhere else you choose.

>### Great themes available
There's a stack of good looking themes included by default. Choose from bootstrap, readthedocs, or any of the 12 bootswatch themes. You can also check out a list of 3rd party themes in the MkDocs wiki, or better yet, add your own.

>### Preview your site as you work
The built-in devserver allows you to preview your documentation as you're writing it. It will even auto-reload whenever you save any changes, so all you need to do to see your latest edits is refresh your browser.

>### Easy to customize
Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing the theme.

## Usage

To run MKdocs container:

```bash
docker run --name mkdocs -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd)/mkdown:/mkdocs/docs -v $(pwd)/html:/var/www/html -itd nutsllc/toybox-mkdocs
```

After running container by ``docker run`` command above, a ``mkdown`` directory and a ``html`` directory will be created in a directory you have run docker command.

``mkdown`` directory is a place for your markdown contents and ``html`` directory is a place for HTML contents generated by Mkdocs.

You must run docker command below to regenerate HTML contents when you put your markdown contents into ``mkdown`` directory.

```bash
docker exec -it mkdocs mkdocs build --config-file /mkdocs/mkdocs.yml
